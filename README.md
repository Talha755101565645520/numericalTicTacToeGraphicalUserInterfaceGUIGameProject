# Important Details about this Project 

I created a Graphical User Interface GUI Game called Numerical_Tic_Tac_Toe in Python 3 using Python's built-in toolkit called Tkinter. The purpose of this program is to 
motivate users, in other words, players of the game by testing their mathematical skills in a game of Numerical_Tic_Tac_Toe where the first player whether it 
be player 1, player 2, or the computer player gets three squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically with numbers that sum up to 15. This game is played when one player 
whether it be player 1, player 2, or the computer player depending on the settings asked in the beginning before playing the Numerical Graphical User Interface GUI Tic Tac Toe
Game is given input for a set of odd numbers when player 1 from 1 through 9 and either player 2 or the computer player based on the user's preference of whether or not they
want to play a 2 player game is given input for a set of even numbers from 2 through 8. If the last third square in the diagnol, horizontal row, or vertical column set of 
squares on the Graphical User Interface GUI Board sums up to 15 when the player is player 2 or the computer player who inputs an even number, then player 2 or the computer 
player will win the game. Then, the diagonal, horizontal row, or vertical column will be highlighted in blue along with the Window Box message stating that Player 2 or the 
Computer Player wins the game along with how much time it took for them to win the game. However, if the last third square in the diagonal, horizontal row, or vertical column 
set of squares on the Graphical User Interface GUI Board sums up to 15 when the player is player 1 who inputs an odd number, then player 1 or the computer player will 
win the game. Again, the diagonal, horizontal row, or vertical column will be highlighted in blue along with the Window Box message stating that Player 1 wins the game.
